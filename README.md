## openDSME (legacy)
openDSME is an open-source implementation of IEEE 802.15.4 DSME. This repository contains its legacy implementation as developed by the Institue of Telematics at Hamburg University of Technology. It is provided as-is and will not receive any further updates. We strongly suggest switching to RIOT for further development.
